# Webscraping-Video-Game-Sales

##This project will be to test out some R code to webscrape VGChartz for their video game sales data.

The data frame generated by this webscraper can be used for analyses but
the information on VGChartz does not seem up to date/completely accurate. 
For example, GTA 5 is split over the various SKUs but the total of the  
seem to have sales that would put it well under 100 million copies; however, recent reports 
suggest that GTA 5 has sold closer to 110 million copies 
(https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-05-13-grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-110m-copies)


This webscraper will generate an R dataframe that pulls the information from the VGChartz. 
It will generate a csv file after it has scraped the data. VGChartz has a large amount of data, 
but many of the games are empty so the data that this scrapes will need to be cleaned afterwards.

One thing to note is that it pulls the "alt text" for the images that are used for the consoles and 
the scraper does not retain the box art images.

Future directions for this is somehow add more information about the game to use it for prediction as well as
potentially add meta-critic scores and/or other reviews to it.

This line was added via Rstudio as a test.

This line was added on Github as a test.
